		SPECIAL RULES

If the five community cards form the player's best hand, then the player is said to be "playing the board" and can only hope to split the pot, because each other player can also use the same five cards to construct the same hand.

If the best hand is shared by more than one player, then the pot is split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in clockwise order.

The minimum raise is equal to the size of the previous bet or raise.

If two players have the same high card, the tie is broken by comparing the next highest card in the hand, and so on until a winner is determined.

An ace can be the lowest card of a straight (ace, 2, 3, 4, 5) or the highest card of a straight (ten, jack, queen, king, ace).
